# :rocket: Governance Template for Cross-AI Handoff Workflows

When your Codex / Claude / Gemini quota runs out, paste the handoff block into the next AI and it picks up where you left off.

- Handoff works across different AI CLIs
- Standard workflow: `PLAN -> READ -> CHANGE -> QC -> PERSIST`
- Keeps governance from drifting, instead of just adding more rules
- A harness engineering component focused on session continuity

**[30-second Quick Start](#quickstart)** · **[Install](#install)** · **[Upgrade](#upgrade)** · **[Quick Operations](#quick-operations)**

> **New here?** Check out the **[Interactive Introduction](https://prompt-templates.github.io/ai-session-governance/)** — a visual guide to what this template does and why it exists.


---

## :bookmark_tabs: Why this exists

With multiple AI tools, handoff is usually what breaks first — not output quality.

Common failure pattern:
- Context resets every time you switch tools
- Fixes pile on top of fixes, rules get messier
- README, handoff docs, and logs stop matching

This template requires:
1. One re-entry path every session
2. One workflow for every task
3. One persistent record before closing

---

## :bookmark_tabs: Built-in safeguards

It also catches a few common AI mistakes:

| Safeguard | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| **PLAN risk grading** | Proceeding with high-risk tasks (≥3 files, ambiguous scope, destructive ops, external systems) before confirming the AI understood correctly — high-risk plans pause for user confirmation |
| **External API Code Safety** | Writing API-calling code from hallucinated endpoint / schema memory; requires doc-verified baseline before coding |
| **Codebase context snapshot** | Relearning tech stack, external services, and key decisions from scratch every session |
| **Test plan governance** | Merging changes without a scenario matrix — expected vs. actual outcomes untracked |
| **Consolidation discipline** | Rule accumulation without checking whether existing rules should be updated first |
| **Doc-sync registry** | Guessing which docs to update after a change — `DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md` maps change category to required updates so AI looks up instead of self-assessing |
| **Session log maintenance** | Session history growing to thousands of lines and consuming AI context window — during closeout, AI applies built-in trigger rules to archive old entries and keep startup context lean |
| **QC fail-path** | AI silently retrying or abandoning failed tests — when tests or builds fail, AI must report what failed, diagnose the cause, and wait for user direction instead of auto-retrying |
| **Closeout ambiguity guard** | Accidentally triggering full session closeout with casual remarks like "thanks, that's all I needed" — AI confirms session-end intent when the expression is ambiguous |

### :small_blue_diamond: How SESSION_LOG.md stays manageable

`dev/SESSION_LOG.md` is read at every session start. In an active project this file can grow to thousands of lines — loading months of history that has no relevance to today's work.

The template handles this with explicit closeout checks (not memory-only rules):

- At closeout, AI checks whether `SESSION_LOG.md` exceeds **400 lines** or contains entries older than **30 days**
- If a trigger is hit, AI archives old entries before writing the new closeout entry
- If no trigger is hit, AI skips archive and writes closeout normally
- Archived entries are moved to `dev/archive/` (never deleted), organized by quarter: `SESSION_LOG_YYYY_QN.md`
- The active log target is ≤ **200 lines** while retaining the 2 most recent sessions
- AI reads only `SESSION_LOG.md` at startup — archive files are not loaded

If you already have a large session log, it is trimmed automatically on the first session close after upgrading. No manual step needed.

## :bookmark_tabs: Recent releases

| Version | What changed | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **v3.0** | Major governance-file slim-down: AGENTS.md cut from 734 to 487 lines (−33.7%) while preserving every rule; system-prompt token cost per session boot down ~15.6%. A legacy quarantine moves 89 historical drift-defense checks into an auto-chained second harness — the main check suite stays lean but bypassing legacy is forbidden during release verification, so historical safeguards are never silently dropped. Users who created `dev/SESSION_STATE_DETAIL.md` or `dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` are now properly backed up on re-install (data-safe upgrade path). | Less governance text in every system prompt → higher rule-adherence rate (industry data: short rules ~89% vs verbose ~35%). Existing local notes are preserved on upgrade. Cross-LLM compatibility maintained across Claude Code, Claude Cowork, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and web LLMs — zero hook dependency. |
| **v2.8** | Hardened the INIT-only packaging boundary: removed references to internal maintainer tooling from `INIT.md` and README, and added regression checks that fail if INIT points to non-installed files. | Prevents first-time install failures in user environments where only `INIT.md` is provided, and automatically catches future boundary drift. |
| **v2.7** | Added a full anti-bloat upgrade for handoff and session history, validated across 30 growth scenarios. Handoff output is now consistently concise, and older log content is automatically moved out of the active startup path when history grows. | Faster startup and lower context waste without losing key handoff information. In stress scenarios, startup payload was reduced by up to **16,096 tokens**, while all required handoff fields remained intact across all test scenarios. |
| **v2.6** | When the AI resumes an older session, it reads `SESSION_LOG.md` to find the "handoff note left for the next AI." The old rule was "find the last such block in the file" — but once the log is manually reorganized or archived, the physically-last block might actually be an older one. Now: find the block inside the entry with the most recent date. The log can be rearranged and the AI still picks the right one. `INIT.md`'s 10-step safety confirmation before install used to be written twice in the same file, with 8+ places where the wording had started to differ; the top copy is now a 3-line pointer to the single authoritative version below, so the two can't drift apart anymore. The small decorative ASCII graphic shown at session start and session end: the old rule said "avoid repeating the previous one" — but AI has no way to remember across sessions, so this rule was wishful thinking. Now: within the same session, the closing graphic must differ from the opening one (AI can actually do this). Pure governance-document edits no longer accidentally trigger the "must generate `CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` before install" requirement. Automated quality checks grew from 169 to 210 — the new ones cover Session ID format, forbidden-command list integrity, and filename enforcement. | Handoff notes no longer get picked wrong; install instructions have one copy instead of two that contradict each other; the start/end session graphics actually alternate; routine doc edits no longer get held up by safety flows; more types of mistakes get caught before release. |
| **v2.5** | Core workflow rules repositioned for better AI attention (moved from attention dead zone to high-priority zone); redundant sections consolidated (net -3 lines); three workflow gaps filled — AI now reports test failures instead of silently retrying, states which phase it re-enters after a deviation stop, and confirms before triggering session closeout on ambiguous expressions | Core rules get more consistent AI compliance; less redundancy to maintain; fewer undefined AI behaviors during failures and handoffs |
| **v2.4** | AI now grades task risk at PLAN phase — high-risk tasks (≥3 files, ambiguous scope, destructive ops, external systems) pause for user confirmation before proceeding; session log entries use a lean format (~60% smaller); archive threshold lowered from 800 to 400 lines, reducing irrelevant history the AI reads at startup | Misunderstood tasks caught before code changes; faster AI startup; more session history fits in less space |
| **v2.3** | Seven clarity fixes from a systematic audit: AI now shows its understanding before acting (PLAN display), names conflicts when user instructions override governance rules, stops and reports when mid-task assumptions turn out wrong, and gives shorter answers to simple questions instead of forced 4-part output | Fewer misunderstood tasks, traceable overrides, less wasted work from wrong assumptions |
| **v2.2** | Session log files no longer grow unbounded — when `SESSION_LOG.md` exceeds 400 lines or has entries older than 30 days, old entries are automatically moved to `dev/archive/`; the active log stays at the last 7–10 sessions | Long-running projects stay lean without manual cleanup; AI startup context is not consumed by months-old history |
| **v2.1** | Two reliability fixes: (1) when receiving a handoff, new agents are now guided more clearly to read governance rules before starting work; (2) after every change, AI must display which docs it updated — if that block is absent from the response, you know to ask | Switching AI tools mid-session is more reliable; doc update gaps are now visible in the response instead of happening silently |
| **v2.0** | `DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md` — deterministic doc-sync registry mapping change category to required doc updates; section markers in `AGENTS.md` (MANDATORY / CONDITIONAL / REFERENCE) | Removes guesswork from doc sync: AI looks up what to update instead of self-assessing |
| **v1.9.0** | Six governance fixes: three-trigger new-session definition, explicit cross-doc sync at closeout, priority list regeneration (replace not append), modification ops precision | Closes real AI behavioral gaps found in field usage — stale priority lists, skipped doc sync, ambiguous scope |
| **v1.8.0** | Context compaction recovery — AI must re-run the startup sequence after compaction instead of trusting the summary's pending tasks | Prevents silent task drift when Claude Code auto-compacts mid-session context |
| **v1.7.0** | Handoff prompt now opens with an explicit instruction to read `AGENTS.md` first, then follow the startup sequence | Handoffs work even if the receiving tool doesn't auto-load governance files |
| **v1.6.0** | Post-install Quick Start printed after setup; `CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` generation backs up and scans more sources (docs/, yaml, .env) | Commands are ready to copy right after install; first-session context is more complete |

## :bookmark_tabs: 30-second Quick Start

1. Open **[INIT.md](INIT.md)** and paste it into your AI CLI.
2. Confirm root and write prompts exactly:
   - `INSTALL_ROOT_OK: <absolute_path>`
   - `INSTALL_WRITE_OK`
3. Start each new session with:

```text
Follow AGENTS.md
```

---

<a id="install"></a>

## :bookmark_tabs: Install

1. Open **[INIT.md](INIT.md)** -> click **Raw** -> copy all
2. Paste into Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI
3. AI runs root safety preflight and prints in order: `pwd`, then `git root`
4. If `pwd` and `git root` differ, AI must stop and let you choose root (no auto-select)
5. AI prints risk checks and dry-run plan (`create` / `merge` / `skip`) before writing
6. You confirm:
   - `INSTALL_ROOT_OK: <absolute_path>`
   - `INSTALL_WRITE_OK`
7. Before first write, AI creates a lightweight backup snapshot at `<PROJECT_ROOT>/dev/init_backup/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/` for existing target governance files
8. AI creates or merges governance files in the confirmed project root
9. AI prints a **Quick Start** block with copy-paste commands — no need to memorize session commands

Don't copy the repo manually. Use `INIT.md` — it handles merging safely into your existing files.

**Already installed and want to upgrade?** Same `INIT.md` flow — see [Upgrading](#upgrade) below.

<a id="upgrade"></a>

## :bookmark_tabs: Upgrading from a previous version

Re-run `INIT.md` with the current version. The steps are identical to initial install.

1. Open **[INIT.md](INIT.md)** → click **Raw** → copy all
2. Paste into your AI CLI (Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI)
3. Confirm: `INSTALL_ROOT_OK: <absolute_path>` then `INSTALL_WRITE_OK`
4. AI backs up existing files, then merges governance sections to the latest version

**Safe upgrade prompt (copy/paste):**

```text
Upgrade governance with this INIT.md in merge-only mode.
Do not overwrite, delete, or reset any of my existing custom governance rules/content/files.
Show the dry-run plan first (create/merge/skip), then wait for my confirmations: INSTALL_ROOT_OK and INSTALL_WRITE_OK.
```

**What the AI does during upgrade:**
- Existing `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` → **merge** (governance sections updated, your custom content preserved)
- `dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md` → **merge** (existing project-specific rows preserved, missing universal rows added)
- `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` → **skip** (session history never touched)
- The dry-run plan shown in step 5 of Install will confirm `merge` / `skip` before any write

Works from any previously installed version.

<a id="quick-operations"></a>

## :bookmark_tabs: Quick Operations

### :small_blue_diamond: 1) Start a session

```text
Follow AGENTS.md
```

### :small_blue_diamond: 2) Close with full handoff

```text
Wrap up this session with full closeout and handover.
```

### :small_blue_diamond: 3) Resume in another AI CLI

```text
<Paste the previous "NEXT SESSION HANDOFF PROMPT (COPY/PASTE)" block here, unchanged.>
```

---

## :bookmark_tabs: Quota-switch handoff flow

1. Work in CLI-A until quota is near limit
2. Ask for closeout and copy the generated handoff block
3. Open CLI-B and paste the block unchanged
4. CLI-B continues from the same baseline using `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` + `SESSION_LOG.md`

This is the primary design target of this repo.

---

## :bookmark_tabs: Platform setup

`AGENTS.md` is the single governance source of truth. `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are thin pointers.

| Platform | Native file | What ships | Existing file action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Codex** | `AGENTS.md` | full governance rules | merge governance sections |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | pointer: `@AGENTS.md` | prepend `@AGENTS.md` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md` | pointer: `@./AGENTS.md` | prepend `@./AGENTS.md` |

> **Codex users:** AGENTS.md exceeds the default 32 KiB context limit. Add `project_doc_max_bytes = 49152` to `~/.codex/config.toml` to load the full file.

---

## :bookmark_tabs: 3 scenarios

### :small_blue_diamond: Scenario 1 — Quota exhausted, switch AI and continue
You hit quota in one CLI and must switch immediately.  
This template preserves baseline, pending tasks, risks, and validation state so work continues without re-explaining context.

### :small_blue_diamond: Scenario 2 — One repo, multiple AI agents
Different agents handle code, docs, and infra.  
Shared handoff/log discipline prevents parallel reality drift.

### :small_blue_diamond: Scenario 3 — Long-lived repo with governance drift
Fixes keep accumulating and docs diverge.  
Consolidation-before-adding rules reduce SOP sprawl and maintenance cost.

## :bookmark_tabs: FAQ

For a visual walkthrough of common questions, see the **[Interactive Introduction](https://prompt-templates.github.io/ai-session-governance/)**.

### :small_blue_diamond: 1) Is this only for large projects?
No. Small repos benefit right away; larger ones see more gain over time.

### :small_blue_diamond: 2) Do I need `PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` on day one?
No. Start with `AGENTS.md` + `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` + `SESSION_LOG.md`.

### :small_blue_diamond: 3) Is this a coding style guide?
No. It governs how AI reads, changes, verifies, and hands over work — not how you write code.

### :small_blue_diamond: 4) Will this slow sessions down?
There's a short read at startup. Usually less overhead than re-explaining context and redoing mistakes.

### :small_blue_diamond: 5) Can I keep my existing docs and internal rules?
Yes. It merges with what you already have — it doesn't overwrite things.

### :small_blue_diamond: 6) When is this overkill?
If you're asking a quick question, doing one-off research, or running a single session you won't come back to — skip this. The startup reads and closeout writes add overhead that only pays off when you'll return to the same project across multiple sessions.

This template was built for ongoing development work: codebases you'll touch again tomorrow, repos where multiple AI tools take turns, projects where "what did we decide last week" actually matters. If your workflow doesn't involve files that change over time, the PLAN→READ→CHANGE→QC→PERSIST cycle has nothing to wrap around.
