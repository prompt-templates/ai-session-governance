You are an AI coding agent. Execute this setup in the current project directory.

Create each file below exactly as shown. If a file already exists, follow the rule for that file. Create the `dev/` directory if it does not exist.
Do not create, modify, merge, prepend, or overwrite any file until the Root Safety Check below is completed and explicitly confirmed by the user.

ROOT SAFETY CHECK (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY FILE WRITE)
Execute the preflight defined in `§5a) Root Scope Guard for Bootstrap / Multi-File Setup` inside FILE 1 below before creating or modifying any file. All 10 steps, both confirmation gates (`INSTALL_ROOT_OK`, `INSTALL_WRITE_OK`), and the backup-snapshot requirement apply exactly as written in §5a. §5a is the single source of truth for bootstrap root safety — do not re-implement, paraphrase, or vary from it.

---

## FILE 1: AGENTS.md
Rule if exists: merge the governance sections into the existing file, preserving existing content.

```
# AGENTS.md instructions for <PROJECT_ROOT>
(If an AGENTS.md already exists in this project's directory, the original content must be preserved and integrated/merged — retaining the strengths of each while coordinating them to complement rather than conflict with one another)

<INSTRUCTIONS>
<!-- MANDATORY STARTUP — read every session: §0 §1 §2 -->
<!-- MANDATORY WORKFLOW — execute every task/closeout: §3 §4 -->
<!-- CONDITIONAL — apply when triggered: §0b §2b §3b §3c §3d §4a §5 §5a §6 §7 §8 §8b §9 -->
<!-- REFERENCE — consult when needed: §10 §11 §12 -->

**CORE RULES — apply to every task without exception:**
§3 Standard Workflow: PLAN → READ → CHANGE → QC → PERSIST
§4 Session Close: update SESSION_HANDOFF.md + SESSION_LOG.md
§5 File Safety: no destructive operations without explicit user approval

## 0) Purpose
This project adopts a "sustainable session governance" model. The AI must be able to resume work in a new session using documentation alone, without requiring the user to repeat context.

The goal is not to accumulate ever more rules, but to ensure that after every round of development, debugging, optimization, or upgrade, the project remains clear, verifiable, handover-ready, and sustainably maintainable.

---

## 0a) Layer Separation (Mandatory)
This project's rules are separated into at least two layers; the AI must not conflate them:

1. Product / System Layer
   - Refers to the project's own functionality, commands, configuration, execution flow, product logic, deployment logic, and external platform integrations.

2. Development Governance Layer
   - Refers to the AI agent's file-reading order, modification process, verification methods, handover procedures, safety rules, and maintenance discipline within this codebase.

Hard rules:
1. Do not treat "product feature rules" as the AI agent's "development governance rules".
2. Do not mistake "development governance processes" for user-facing product functionality.
3. When encountering a bug / error / unexpected behavior, first determine which layer the issue belongs to before deciding the debug path.
4. Do not skip layer classification and directly modify code, configuration, or documentation.

---

## 1) Single Entry (Mandatory)
**Definition of "new session"** — any of the following triggers the full §1 startup sequence below:
1. A fresh conversation / thread
2. Context compaction / context recovery — the conversation history has been compressed into a summary by the platform; the compaction summary is not an authoritative source for project state, pending tasks, risks, or open items; actual governance files always take priority per §2
3. Agent handoff — a different AI agent takes over

At the start of every new session, the AI must read the following files in this order:

1. `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
2. `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`
3. `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` (if it exists; provides tech stack, directory map, build commands, External Services, and Key Decisions)
4. `dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` (if it exists; serves as the advanced authoritative specification)

If `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` or `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` is missing, the AI must create a minimal version before beginning development.

If `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` does not exist, generate it on first session:
0. If the file already exists for any reason, back it up to `dev/init_backup/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_UTC>/` before changes
1. Scan present project files (not limited to): docs (`README*.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/**/*.md`); package manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `requirements.txt`, `composer.json`); service / env clues (`.env.example`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `*.yaml` / `*.yml` in root or `config/`)
2. Extract and integrate — consolidate same service / dep / decision across files; do not duplicate
3. Fill: Stack, Directory Map, Key Entry Points, Build & Run, External Services, Key Decisions, AI Maintenance Log
4. Record scanned files in `AI Maintenance Log`; never modify source files (read-only scan)

After reading `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`, the AI must locate the latest `### Next Session Handoff Prompt (Verbatim)` block — defined as the block inside the session entry with the most recent UTC date (the `^## <YYYY-MM-DD>` heading with the latest date, regardless of the entry's physical position in the file; for multiple entries sharing the same date, the physically topmost entry wins — closeouts must prepend new entries above older ones) — and use that block as startup execution seed context for PLAN, subject to the precedence rules in §2 rule 5. Receiving a Handoff Prompt as conversation input does not substitute for this startup sequence; the file reads listed above must still be executed in full.

After completing the session file reads, display exactly one random "Boot Visual Cue" style from the set below.
Selection rule: randomize across styles uniformly. Cross-session memory of the previous style is not expected or required.

## 2) Source of Truth Priority
When documents conflict, defer to the §1 read order as priority (first = highest), then other README / docs / comments / tests. Verbal memory and speculation must not be used as a basis for decisions.

Supplementary rules:
1. `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and `SESSION_LOG.md` represent the "current state"
2. `CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` represents stable project facts that change only when tech stack, External Services, or Key Decisions change
3. `PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` represents long-term stable rules and the complete authoritative reference
4. If current state is inconsistent with older specification, defer to handoff / log first; remediate specification drift during PERSIST
5. Latest `Next Session Handoff Prompt (Verbatim)` block in SESSION_LOG = operational seed context, but does not override higher-priority current-state facts in SESSION_HANDOFF / latest log
6. When a user instruction conflicts with a rule in this document: (a) state which rule is in conflict; (b) explain risk of overriding; (c) if user confirms override → comply and record override in `SESSION_LOG.md`

---

## 2b) Issue Triage (Mandatory)
On any bug / error / regression / unexpected behavior: classify source before reading files or making changes. Categories: code logic / configuration / environment-permissions-runtime / external dependency or platform behavior / usage error / documentation drift.

Before classification is complete:
1. No large-scale code changes
2. No arbitrary reverts
3. Do not equate a single error message directly with the root cause

Note: Targeted file reads for the purpose of determining issue source are permitted during triage. This does not substitute for the full §3 READ coverage required before entering CHANGE.

---

## 3) Standard Workflow (Mandatory)
Every task must follow this workflow and clearly label each phase in the response:

1. PLAN
   - Objective, scope, acceptance criteria
   - State explicitly: "My understanding: [1-sentence restatement of user intent]", "Impact scope: [files / modules to modify]", "Assumptions and risks: [list inferences, flag uncertainty, note at least one way the approach could be wrong]"
   - Risk level — HIGH or LOW (any one = HIGH): (a) likely affects ≥3 files; (b) user instruction lacks target files / behavior / end state; (c) involves deletion, rename, or irreversible operations; (d) involves external systems (API calls, deploy, publish); (e) modifies governance rules (AGENTS.md, INIT.md, or similar)
   - HIGH → present PLAN and **wait for user confirmation** before READ; LOW → proceed to READ
   - §3d trigger met → define test scenario matrix before READ

2. READ — minimum coverage before entering CHANGE:
   - Read the full context of the section to be modified in the target file
   - Search for other occurrences of the same term / rule / feature across the repo
   - Check whether a single source of truth already exists (SSOT / master spec / runbook / baseline definition)
   - Review the most recent `SESSION_LOG.md` entry related to the topic

3. CHANGE
   - Minimal necessary modifications, no unrelated refactoring
   - If execution diverges from PLAN (unexpected state, wrong assumptions, scope change needed): stop, report the divergence to the user, and wait for direction rather than attempting self-correction
   - After receiving user direction following a deviation stop: if scope or objective changed, restart from PLAN; if only approach changed, restart from CHANGE with updated context; in either case, state which phase is being re-entered and why

4. QC
   - Run tests / checks, list results (test/check commands and key outcomes)
   - If a test scenario matrix was defined in PLAN (§3d): verify each scenario and record actual result; summarize overall as PASS / PASS with notes / FAIL
   - If the task involves batch deletion or batch modification, a dry-run (e.g. `ls` / `find` preview, PowerShell `-WhatIf`, etc.) with a "blast radius" list must be provided for confirmation first
   - If QC reveals test failures or build errors: (a) report to user — what was attempted, what failed, and preliminary diagnosis; (b) do not return to CHANGE or retry without user direction; (c) provide failure summary, likely root cause, and proposed fix approach

5. PERSIST
   - Update `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`
   - Apply the same cross-document sync conditions as §4 closeout: if tech stack, directory structure, build commands, external services, or Key Decisions changed in this task — update `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` now, not at closeout
   - If `dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` exists and carries status for the completed work — update it in the same pass
   - **DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan (mandatory visible output):** Before completing PERSIST, output a `### DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan` block: No file changes this task → `### DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan — SKIP (no file changes this task)`. Registry exists → list matched rows `Change Category | Required Doc Updates | Status` (`✓ Done` / `N/A` / `⚠ Skipped (reason)`); update all required docs; no matching row → add it first (`✓ Row added`). Registry absent → `### DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan — SKIP (registry not present)`. Absence of this block in the response = scan was skipped; user may immediately request the agent to complete it.

---

## 3b) Consolidation / Integration Discipline (Mandatory)
Minimal modification ≠ stack-only. Before adding any new rule, explanation, exception, baseline, or runbook content, prefer in this order: modify existing definition / merge duplicates / retire outdated wording / converge to single source of truth / keep only a reference in other locations.

Hard rule: same rule, threshold, enumeration, or operational standard = one-rule-one-place. If new content supersedes old, retire old simultaneously; two competing standards must not coexist long-term.

Trigger a Consolidation Pass before CHANGE if any apply:
1. The same rule already appears in ≥2 files
2. The same issue has been patched >2 times
3. A new rule overlaps, duplicates, or creates exceptions against an old rule
4. README / handoff / spec / tests show inconsistent wording
5. Continuing to stack would increase comprehension or maintenance cost

A Consolidation Pass: identify primary location → merge duplicates → retire outdated wording → record rationale in `SESSION_LOG.md`.

---

## 3c) Release / Merge Gate (Mandatory when applicable)
Whenever a task involves a merge, release, deploy, publish, GA, or hotfix completion claim, the following gates must be cleared first; none may be skipped:

1. Independent Review Pass
   - Conduct an independent review (may be performed by a second agent, a review mode, or a structured self-check checklist)
   - Must cover: correctness, consistency, regression risk, documentation sync (verify all `dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md` entries affected by this release's changes are updated), toolchain compatibility

2. Machine Verification
   - Run the project's applicable build / type-check / lint / tests / regression / consistency checks
   - If the project has multiple harness layers (e.g. main + legacy / extended quarantine), all layers must execute; bypass flags (e.g. `LEGACY_SKIP`) are forbidden during release verification

3. Evidence Check
   - To claim ready / merged / released / GA, corresponding verification evidence must exist

4. Failure Rule
   - If any critical check fails, do not claim ready / release / GA

---

## 3d) Test Plan Design (Mandatory when applicable)

**Trigger conditions:** apply §3d when task involves new user-facing features / commands / behaviors; changes to existing behavior (incl. governance rule changes); external API / service integrations; multi-step user flows (install, onboarding, upgrade paths). Not required for session log updates, whitespace / formatting only, or comment-only changes.

**Scenario categories:** identify ≥1 scenario per relevant category — Normal flow (happy path); Boundary / edge (limits, empty inputs, first-run vs. repeat-run); Error / failure path; Regression (existing behavior must remain unchanged). Adapt to project type: code (unit / integration / E2E); governance / documentation (rule presence, parity, grep-verifiable assertions); prompt engineering (output format, behavioral assertions).

**Scenario format (fill Actual column at QC phase):**

| Scenario | Precondition | Action / input | Expected | Actual | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [name] | [starting state] | [what happens] | [expected outcome] | [fill at QC] | PASS/FAIL |

Result values: PASS, PASS with notes (minor gaps but does not block), or FAIL.

**Recording location:** ≤5 scenarios → inline in current SESSION_LOG entry under `### Test Scenarios`; >5 or spanning multiple sessions → reference in SESSION_HANDOFF `Regression / Verification Notes` + full matrix in SESSION_LOG. At QC phase: fill Actual column; summarize overall result in SESSION_LOG.

---

## 4) Session Close Rules (Mandatory)
On end-of-session intent ("wrap up" / "handover" / "close session" / "that's it for today" / similar), perform closeout automatically without item-by-item confirmation. If ambiguous (task vs session end), confirm session-end intent first.

At closeout, update minimum: `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`. If session changed tech stack / directory / build commands / external services / Key Decisions, also update `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` (append `AI Maintenance Log` entry with session ID + summary).

Each closeout records at minimum: Date (UTC); Session ID; Completed items; Pending items; Next priorities (max 3 — SESSION_LOG summary field only; full prioritized list in `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` Open Priorities); Risks / blockers.

**Session log entry format:** Use lean key-value style (see `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` template). Target ~20-30 lines per entry excluding the Handoff Prompt block. Omit conditional sections (Fix Record, Consolidation) when they have no content — do not write empty blocks. Do not record "Files read" — it has no value for future sessions.

**Session handoff compactness budget** (mandatory at every closeout):
1. `Current Baseline`: keep to concise state facts only; cap at 6 numbered lines
2. `Open Priorities`: max 5 items, one line per item
3. `Known Risks / Blockers`: unresolved active risks only; max 7 items
4. `Last Session Record`: compact summary only; keep detailed evidence in `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`
5. If content would exceed these limits: move detail to `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` (current entry) or `dev/SESSION_STATE_DETAIL.md` and leave a short reference in handoff
6. No-loss rule: compaction must not discard information; detail is relocated, not deleted

**Next Session Handoff Prompt budget** (mandatory at every closeout): Section 2 fenced `text` block ≤24 lines (lines inside fence only); keep two required opening lines verbatim + required fields from §4 rule 5 in compact form; `Key files changed`: max 6 bullets (overflow → one bullet `- Additional files: see SESSION_LOG Changed`); `Known risks / blockers / cautions`: max 5 bullets; overflow → relocate to current `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` entry with short reference in prompt block.

**Open Priorities regeneration** (mandatory at every closeout): regenerate `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` Open Priorities — not copy-pasted forward. Remove items completed this session; scan recent `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` entries for new pending items; re-rank and overwrite previous list (replace, not append). Hard rule: do not copy-paste old priorities without re-checking current project state.

**Closeout smart-skip gate** (mandatory at every closeout):
1. Before drafting closeout output, evaluate whether this session has meaningful deltas
2. Use `No-Change Closeout` only if all are true:
   - No files were created/modified/deleted in this session
   - No new or updated decision/requirement/risk/blocker/pending item was introduced
   - No DOC_SYNC row was triggered
3. `No-Change Closeout` still requires:
   - Run §4a check command
   - Update `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` with a concise no-change entry
   - Generate and persist `Next Session Handoff Prompt (Verbatim)`
   - Output `### DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan — SKIP (no file edits in this session)`
4. If any condition above is false: run the full closeout flow

Supplementary rules:
1. Update session record even if no code changes (research / analysis / discussion / decisions count). After closeout, response lists files updated + what changed; includes copy-paste-ready "Next Session Handoff Prompt" generated from actual project state (no hardcoded sentences).
2. The "Next Session Handoff Prompt" must include at minimum:
   - Opening line: use this verbatim template — do not paraphrase or omit any file — paste as two consecutive lines to ensure cross-tool handoffs work even when the receiving tool does not auto-load `AGENTS.md`:
     `Read AGENTS.md first (governance SSOT), then follow its §1 startup sequence:`
     `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md → dev/SESSION_LOG.md → dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md (if exists) → dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md (if exists)`
   - Current objective and progress state
   - Pending tasks in priority order
   - Key files changed in this session
   - Known risks / blockers / cautions
   - Validation status + `Post-startup first action:` (executed only after §1 startup complete, not before)
3. Closeout response = exactly 3 sections in order: Section 1 `SESSION CLOSEOUT SUMMARY`; Section 2 `NEXT SESSION HANDOFF PROMPT (COPY/PASTE)` as single fenced `text` block (copy/paste-ready); Section 3 `CLOSEOUT VISUAL CUE` (one random style from set below).
4. Randomization rule: within a single session, the Closeout Visual Cue must differ from the Boot Visual Cue displayed earlier in the same session. Across sessions, randomize uniformly — previous session's style is not tracked.
5. Use separator lines between sections:
    - Major separator: `========================================`
    - Minor separator: `----------------------------------------`
6. Closeout output skeleton must follow this layout:
```text
========================================
SESSION CLOSEOUT SUMMARY
========================================
<summary bullets>

----------------------------------------
NEXT SESSION HANDOFF PROMPT (COPY/PASTE)
----------------------------------------
<single fenced text block>

----------------------------------------
CLOSEOUT VISUAL CUE
----------------------------------------
<one random style from A/B/C>
```
7. After generating Section 2, write the exact same fenced `text` block verbatim into current `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` entry under `### Next Session Handoff Prompt (Verbatim)` — replace if already exists (no duplicates, no paraphrase, no truncation, no reformatting).

## 4a) Session Log Maintenance (Conditional — auto-triggered at closeout)

Before writing the new session entry to `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` during closeout, evaluate triggers.

**Trigger (either):** `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` exceeds 400 lines; OR oldest session entry is dated more than 30 days ago. If neither: proceed normally.

**Mechanism enforcement (mandatory):** At closeout, evaluate triggers directly from `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` — Line trigger: total lines > 400; Date trigger: oldest `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading older than 30 days. If either is true → execute archive before writing closeout entry; if both false → skip archive. User-facing closeout must not require Python or any non-default runtime. Do not rely on memory or user reminder; explicit trigger evaluation is the execution gate. If evaluation fails due to environment / tooling limits: continue closeout and record `§4a maintenance skipped: <reason>` in current SESSION_LOG entry.

**If triggered, perform archiving before writing the new entry:**
1. Create `dev/archive/` if it does not exist
2. Identify entries to archive: Line-count trigger → archive oldest until `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` ≤ 200 lines (always retain 2 most recent regardless of size); Date trigger → archive all entries older than 30 days (always retain 2 most recent regardless of date)
3. Archive filename by year and quarter: `dev/archive/SESSION_LOG_YYYY_QN.md` (e.g., `SESSION_LOG_2026_Q1.md` for Jan–Mar 2026); span multiple quarters → one file per quarter; existing target file → append (do not overwrite)
4. Move identified entries to archive file(s)
5. Add / update archive pointer comment immediately after file header in `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`: `<!-- Archives: dev/archive/ — entries moved when >400 lines or oldest entry >30 days -->`
6. Proceed with writing the new session entry to the now-trimmed `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`

**First-run auto-transition:** If `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` has no archive pointer and either trigger applies, apply the same steps. Existing large files are trimmed automatically on the first closeout after upgrading — no manual migration needed.

**Hard rules:** Never delete session entries — archive only. `dev/archive/` files are not part of §1 mandatory read list; do not read at startup unless user explicitly requests historical lookup. The most recent session entry's `### Next Session Handoff Prompt (Verbatim)` block must remain in `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`.

---

## 0b) External Platform Alignment (Mandatory when applicable)
Scope: §0b applies when the AI writes, executes, or debugs code / commands that interact with external systems at runtime. Editing documentation, governance rules, or templates that reference external services without making actual calls does not trigger §0b — External API Code Safety preconditions (including CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md generation) do not apply in such cases.

When a task involves external platforms, frameworks, APIs, CLIs, deployment systems, cloud services, third-party SDKs, package managers, or official toolchains: do not guess commands, parameters, limitations, version differences, or platform behavior from memory. Before related work, align against: official documentation; release notes / changelog; official repo / original specifications; relevant SSOT / runbook / integration docs in this project. If alignment is not completed: do not treat guesses as conclusions; do not output high-risk commands; label what is verified vs pending.

### External API Code Safety (Mandatory when writing API-calling code)

Before writing any code that calls an external API endpoint:
0. If `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` does not yet exist, generate it first per §1 — External Services section is required to record API facts
1. Fetch current official documentation for the specific endpoint
2. Record in `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` External Services before writing code: Base URL + endpoint path (do not assume from memory); Current API version; Auth method + header format; Required params; Forbidden / deprecated params; Response schema + exact parsing path for needed data; Official docs URL; `Doc-reviewed: <date> (<session ID>)`
3. If official documentation cannot be fetched: Do not write API-calling code; state what is blocked and why; ask user for documentation
4. Training-data knowledge must never be the sole source for endpoint paths, parameter names, or response structure — treat prior knowledge as "possibly outdated — verify first"

External Services block format in `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` (one block per API):
```
### [API Name]
- Base URL:
- Version:
- Auth:
- Required params:
- Forbidden params:
- Response path:
- Official docs:
- Doc-reviewed:  (date + session ID — documentation read and fields recorded)
- Test-verified: (date + session ID — API call made and response confirmed correct)
- Notes:
```

When reading an existing External Services block before writing code: `Test-verified` present → reliable (re-verify the specific endpoint + params if from prior session); `Doc-reviewed` only → use with caution and annotate generated code with `awaiting test-verification` comment at top of each calling function / method; both empty or missing → full verification ritual required first. After any re-verification: update date + session ID. If re-verification reveals API changes: update affected fields, record before/after in Notes, flag affected code for review.

---

## 5) File Safety Governance (Strict)
The AI is prohibited from executing high-risk destructive operations, including but not limited to:

1. `rm -rf` / `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` (without explicit approval)
2. `git reset --hard`
3. `git clean -fdx`
4. Batch overwriting unknown files
5. Overwriting or deleting files unrelated to the current task
6. Any privilege escalation (sudo, system-level permission changes) unless explicitly approved by the user
7. Strictly prohibited from invoking external shells (e.g. `cmd /c`, `sh -c`, `bash -c`, `powershell -Command`) to perform file system modification operations (create, delete, overwrite, move, rename); must use the current environment's native commands with direct arguments
8. When handling file paths, strictly prohibited from using raw string interpolation to construct paths; must use native path handling APIs / objects (e.g. `Join-Path`, `path.join`, `Path.Combine`, etc.)

## 5a) Root Scope Guard for Bootstrap / Multi-File Setup (Mandatory)
Before any bootstrap / setup task creating or modifying multiple governance files (e.g. executing `INIT.md`), complete this preflight; do not write any file before explicit user confirmation:

1. Detect and print paths in this order: `pwd` absolute; `git root` absolute (or `none`)
2. If `pwd` and `git root` both exist and differ: hard stop before any write; print exactly two options (1) Use `pwd` (2) Use `git root`; require explicit user choice; AI must not auto-select in mismatch case
3. After root is chosen, print chosen `<PROJECT_ROOT>` as absolute path
4. Run and print root risk checks: shared workspace / runtime / tool-internal directory? parent / sibling directories contain governance files suggesting scope too high? target appears to be framework / tool runtime repo instead of user's intended project?
5. Print dry-run install plan: `create` (newly created files); `merge` (merged / prepended); `skip` (left unchanged)
6. Require exact confirmation reply: `INSTALL_ROOT_OK: <absolute_path>`
7. If the confirmation path does not exactly match the proposed absolute path, abort setup (no writes)
8. After step 6 passes, require second confirmation reply before first write: `INSTALL_WRITE_OK`
9. After `INSTALL_WRITE_OK` and before first write, create a lightweight backup snapshot: directory `<PROJECT_ROOT>/dev/init_backup/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_UTC>/`; copy only existing target files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`, `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md`, `dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md`, `dev/SESSION_STATE_DETAIL.md`, `dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md`, if present); preserve relative paths under `<PROJECT_ROOT>`; native filesystem copy (cross-platform), no git required
10. If high-risk markers are detected, default action is abort and ask user to specify a safer subdirectory explicitly

---

## 6) No Escalation Deletion Policy
On "file is locked / insufficient permissions / cannot delete / cannot overwrite": do not escalate privileges; do not use high-risk commands to bypass; do not use OS low-level APIs, COM objects, WMI, AppleScript, unconventional syscall wrappers, or other opaque means to force-remove files; output a "manual action list" to the user containing: file / directory path; failure reason; safe methods already attempted; recommended manual steps.

Note: normal external network service APIs / Web SDKs for project feature development are exempt; this clause applies only to high-risk file system force-removal.

---

## 7) Change Scope Discipline
1. Only modify files directly related to the current task
2. Do not perform unrelated refactoring
3. Do not revert the user's existing modifications
4. If unexpected changes not caused by the AI are discovered, stop and confirm with the user first
5. If behavior, processes, interfaces, acceptance criteria, runbooks, release conditions, or related matters change, the corresponding documentation (see `dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md` if it exists) and regression must be updated in the same changeset
6. If the current fix would make the project's rules more complex, first assess whether consolidation can reduce overall complexity

---

## 8) Regression + Lessons-to-Rule Discipline
On any bug / process issue / incident root cause / recurring error fix:
1. Add / update a regression case
2. Query `dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md` (if it exists) for doc impact scope; update all listed entries for this change category
3. Record in `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`: Problem; Root Cause; Fix; Verification

Codify the lesson as a rule if the issue caused: release incident; wasted version; user-visible error; data risk / security risk; multiple rework cycles / repeated mistakes; long-term drift between documentation and implementation. Codification methods (any combination): add SOP clause; add check step; add consistency / policy check; update `PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` (if exists); update `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` baseline / known risks / start checklist.

---

## 8b) Rule Promotion Threshold (Mandatory)
Not every issue is rule-worthy. Promote to long-term SOP only if any apply:
1. Recurring
2. Can cause release incident
3. Can cause data / security risk
4. Significantly wastes versions, labor, or regression cost
5. Cannot be resolved by individual patches alone
6. Recurs across multi-agent / multi-session collaboration

Otherwise: fix original definition / add regression / update log / fix runbook or spec — not a new permanent rule.

Hard rule: do not substitute new rules for root-cause fixes; do not let SOPs grow without limit; when adding a long-term rule, check whether old ones can be integrated or retired.

If §8 triggers but §8b promotion criteria not met: record in `SESSION_LOG.md` and mark `monitoring — promote to rule if recurrence is observed`.

---

## 9) Toolchain / Policy Compatibility (Conditional Mandatory)
If the project has any of these mechanisms, run the corresponding checks and report results after every modification to affected files: static scanners; linter / formatter; type checker; packaging / publishing constraints; security / policy checks; framework-specific compile checks; CI-required local parity checks. Do not assume "it should be fine" and skip compatibility verification.

---

## 10) Optional Master Spec Mode
Recommended when project qualifies on any of:
1. Multi-module / multi-agent collaboration
2. Long-term maintenance
3. Has release / deploy / support lifecycle
4. Has complex acceptance criteria, runbooks, or regression definitions
5. Same rule referenced across multiple files

Positioning:
- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`: current state
- `SESSION_LOG.md`: session-by-session history
- `PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md`: complete, stable, long-term authoritative specification

Active trigger (at PERSIST): if `dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` does not exist, suggest creation when either applies:
1. User explicitly requested it this session
2. Session established architecture decisions, tech stack choices, or core feature requirements, AND at least one condition above is met

Suggestion must state: which trigger applied, decisions ready to consolidate, and a ready-to-use creation prompt. Record under **Known Risks** (not Open Priorities — that section is regenerated and would lose the entry): `PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC suggestion issued: [session ID] [date].` Do not re-suggest unless new major decisions appear after that date.

Filename enforcement: path must be exactly `dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md`. Do not use alternative names such as `SPEC.md`, `MASTER_SPEC.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.

---

## 11) Output Contract
Every AI response in CHANGE or PERSIST phase must include at minimum: What was done; Why it was done that way; Verification results; Next-step recommendations (if any). Responses that contain only clarifying questions, status updates, or simple information lookups are not bound by this contract but should remain clear and useful.

---

## 12) Multi-Agent Session ID Standard
Format: `<AgentName>_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMM>` (UTC). Examples: `Codex_20260227_1015`, `Claude_20260227_1015`, `Gemini_20260227_1015`. Platform-specific runtime / thread / session identifiers may be appended for reference but must not replace this standard format.

Historical entries (no `_HHMM` suffix or alt forms like `_YYYYMMDDa`) are not retroactively rewritten; new entries must follow `<AgentName>_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMM>`.

## FILE 2: CLAUDE.md
Rule if exists: prepend `@AGENTS.md` as the very first line, keep all existing content below it.

```
<!-- Governance SSOT: AGENTS.md — this file bridges Claude Code auto-discovery. -->
<!-- Already have a CLAUDE.md? Just add the @import line below to your existing file. -->
@AGENTS.md
```

---

## FILE 3: GEMINI.md
Rule if exists: prepend `@./AGENTS.md` as the very first line, keep all existing content below it.

```
<!-- Governance SSOT: AGENTS.md — this file bridges Gemini CLI auto-discovery. -->
<!-- Already have a GEMINI.md? Just add the @import line below to your existing file. -->

## FILE 4: dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md
Rule if exists: skip, do not overwrite.

```
# Session Handoff
<!-- Compactness budget: Current Baseline max 6 lines; Open Priorities max 5; Known Risks max 7; keep details in SESSION_LOG. -->

## Current Baseline
1. Version:
2. Core commands / features (summary only; details in latest SESSION_LOG):
3. Regression baseline:
4. Release / merge status:
5. Active branch / environment:
6. External platforms / dependencies in scope:

## Layer Map
1. Product / System Layer:
2. Development Governance Layer:
3. Current task belongs to which layer:
4. Known layer-boundary risks:

## Mandatory Start Checklist
1. Read `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
2. Read `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`
3. Read `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` (if exists)
4. Read `dev/PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` (if exists)
5. Confirm working tree / file status
6. Run baseline checks:
7. Confirm environment / dependency state:
8. Confirm whether external platform alignment is required:
9. Search for related SSOT / spec / runbook before change:
10. Search for duplicate rule / duplicate term / prior related fixes:

## Open Priorities (max 5; one line per item)
1.
2.
3.

## Known Risks / Blockers (max 7 unresolved active risks)
1.
2.
3.

## Regression / Verification Notes
1. Required checks:
2. Current failing checks (if any):
3. Release / merge blocking conditions:

## Consolidation Watchlist
1. Rules currently duplicated across files:
2. Areas showing accretive drift:
3. Candidate items for consolidation / retirement:

## Update Rule
This file and `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` must be updated at the end of every session.
If the session's changes affect behavior, acceptance criteria, specifications, runbooks, release conditions, or external platform integrations, query `dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md` (if it exists) for the complete scope of affected docs and update all listed entries.
If the session's fix involves adding a new rule, first check whether the existing definition should be integrated or outdated wording retired — avoid stacking without consolidating.

## Last Session Record (compact summary; details in SESSION_LOG)
1. UTC date:
2. Session ID:
3. Completed:
4. Pending:
5. Next priorities (max 3):
6. Risks / blockers:
7. Files materially changed:
8. Validation summary:
9. Consolidation actions taken:
```

## FILE 6: dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md
Rule if exists: preserve all existing rows; ensure the universal rows in the template are present — add any that are missing without removing custom rows added by the project.

```
# Doc Sync Checklist
<!-- LOCAL PROJECT RECORD -->
<!--
  USAGE: At PERSIST phase, if any file was created or modified during CHANGE:
  1. Identify the change category in the registry below
  2. Execute all "Required Doc Updates" for matched rows
  3. Record triggered rows in SESSION_LOG under "Doc Sync"
  4. If your change type has no matching row: add the row first, then proceed
     (prevents this registry from going stale)
-->

## Change Category Registry

| Change Category | Required Doc Updates | Verification Method |
|---|---|---|
| Governance rule change (AGENTS.md) | INIT.md FILE 1 mirror; README if behavior is user-facing | grep parity check |
| Tech stack / build / dependency change | CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md Stack or Build section | manual review |
| External API / service change | CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md External Services block | block format check |
| New governance file added to install | §5a backup list in AGENTS.md; INIT.md ROOT SAFETY CHECK backup list; INIT.md FILE 1 §5a | grep check |
| Session-log maintenance policy changed | AGENTS.md §4a mechanism enforcement; INIT.md FILE 1 §4a + §5a backup list; README*.md safeguards section | grep + policy parity check |
| New project doc added | This file — add a row for the new doc's update triggers | row presence check |
| _[Add project-specific rows below this line]_ | | |

## Anti-pattern: No Matching Row

If your change has no matching row above:
- Do NOT skip silently — add the missing row first, then proceed
- Record the registry addition in SESSION_LOG under `Doc Sync: registry updated`
- Reason: a stale registry is worse than no registry (false safety net)
```

---

After creating all files, confirm:
- Which `<PROJECT_ROOT>` absolute path was confirmed
- Whether `INSTALL_ROOT_OK` and `INSTALL_WRITE_OK` were both explicitly confirmed
- Backup snapshot path and which files were backed up (or `none`)
- Which files were created
- Which were skipped (already existed)
- Which were merged (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md with existing content; dev/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md if it existed)
- Which were replaced (`none` in this template)

Then say: "Governance setup complete.

════════════════════════════════════════
 QUICK START — copy and paste as needed
════════════════════════════════════════

1) Start a new session
   ────────────────────
   Follow AGENTS.md

2) Close session with full handoff
   ────────────────────────────────
   Wrap up this session with full closeout and handover.

3) Resume in another AI tool (after quota switch)
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   <Paste the NEXT SESSION HANDOFF PROMPT (COPY/PASTE) block from the previous session, unchanged.>

════════════════════════════════════════

Note: `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` is not created during install. It will be auto-generated by the AI in your first session by scanning existing project files (README.md, architecture docs, package manifests). No action needed.

If `dev/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md` already exists (e.g., re-installing into an existing project), it was backed up to `dev/init_backup/<timestamp>/` above. Do not overwrite it — the AI will read and update it at session start rather than regenerating from scratch."
