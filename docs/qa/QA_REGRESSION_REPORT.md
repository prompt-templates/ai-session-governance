# QA Regression Report

Date: 2026-04-25 (UTC)
Scope: v3.0 GA + v3.0.1 root-fix — Phase 1 legacy quarantine, Phase 2 AGENTS.md L4 reduction, §5a backup-list completeness hotfix, release-doc sync governance + R29 regression series, on top of v2.8 baseline

## Summary

- Total checks: 249 — 160 main (`docs/qa/run_checks.sh`) + 89 legacy auto-chain (`docs/qa/legacy_checks.sh`)
- Pass: 249
- Fail: 0
- Sandbox install QC: 3 HIGH-risk scenarios PASS (re-install with user overflow files / §5a pwd≠git-root mismatch / §4 closeout end-to-end)
- Matrix QC audit (10-dim) on sandbox: PASS (LOW finding from v3.0-rc.1 resolved by v3.0-rc.2)

**Run automated checks:** `bash docs/qa/run_checks.sh` (from project root, ~10 seconds, auto-chains legacy)

Note: Feature round 16 (v2.6 re-audit fixes), Feature round 17 (v2.7 root-fix executable maintenance + compactness budget), Feature round 18 (v2.8 INIT-only package-boundary hardening) → all 89 R11/R26/R27 checks moved to legacy harness in v3.0 (see `docs/qa/MIGRATION_NOTES.md`).
Note: Feature round 19 (v3.0 Phase 1 legacy quarantine) — added `H01` staleness health check + `LEGACY_SKIP=1` bypass governance.
Note: Feature round 20 (v3.0-rc.2 §5a backup hotfix) — added `041a`/`041b`/`041c`/`041d` checks for `SESSION_STATE_DETAIL.md` + `PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC.md` in §5a backup list; tightened check `038` grep anchor.
Note: Feature round 21 (v3.0.1 release-doc sync governance) — added `R29` series checks for README/index.html/LATEST.md release-tag sync.

Note: Check (82) expected value updated — INIT.md fence count changed from 26 to 28 (+2 from FILE 6).
Note: Checks 112–125 added for Feature Round 7 (v2.1 Handoff chain fixes + DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan enforcement).
Note: Checks 126–139 added for Feature Round 8 (v2.2 §4a Session Log Maintenance auto-archive rule).
Note: Checks (114)/(115) expected value updated from 1 to 2 — §2b triage read note added "does not substitute" phrase (A4 fix); original §1 startup clarification remains intact.
Note: Checks 140–155 added for Feature Round 9 (v2.3 Governance audit fixes: PLAN display, conflict arbitration, triage reads, CHANGE deviation, §8/§8b bridging, §11 scope, FILE 4 checklist).

## What was validated

1. Governance rule integrity (`AGENTS.md`, `INIT.md`)
- Startup must read latest `Next Session Handoff Prompt (Verbatim)` from `SESSION_LOG.md` as plan seed context.
- Closeout must persist Section 2 handoff block verbatim back into `SESSION_LOG.md`.
- Duplicate verbatim subsection behavior must replace existing block (no append duplication).
- Backup snapshot rule remains present and cross-platform (`dev/init_backup/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_UTC>/`, no git required).

2. Bootstrap template integrity (`INIT.md`)
- Embedded `SESSION_LOG.md` template includes `### Next Session Handoff Prompt (Verbatim)` section.
- Post-install confirmation requirements include backup snapshot reporting.

3. Multilingual README consistency
- EN / zh-TW / zh-CN / JA all include:
  - install backup step (`init_backup`)
  - runtime screenshots (`launch.png`, `closesession.png`)
  - language-localized overview infographic (`overview_infograph_en/tw/cn/ja.png`)
- No stale `overview_infograph.png` reference remains in README files.

4. Asset and markdown structure checks
- All referenced image assets exist and are non-zero size.
- Markdown code-fence counts are even in `AGENTS.md` and `INIT.md`.

## Feature round 10 (2026-04-08): v2.4 — PLAN self-challenge, lean log format, archive threshold reduction

Root cause addressed: "lost in the middle" research (Stanford/Anthropic 2023) shows 30%+ accuracy drop for mid-context content. 800-line SESSION_LOG sits in the attention dead zone. Lean format reduces entry size ~60%. Self-challenge forces adversarial thinking at PLAN phase.

### Parity sentinel

| Check | Command | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fence counts | `grep -c "^\x60\x60\x60" AGENTS.md` / `INIT.md` | AGENTS=16, INIT=28 | PASS |

## Feature round 11 (2026-04-14): v2.5 — Harness optimization (attention restructure + consolidation + gap fixes)

Root cause addressed: "Lost in the Middle" U-shaped attention curve places §3 Standard Workflow (the core harness rule) in the attention dead zone (line 225 of 695). Consolidation reduces redundancy. Three behavioral gaps (QC fail-path, deviation resume, closeout ambiguity) filled.

Changes: Attention anchor at file top (I); §0b moved to CONDITIONAL zone after §4a (H); §2 consolidated to reference §1 (F); §2c merged into §3 READ (E); DOC_SYNC block streamlined (G); QC fail-path added (A); deviation resume guidance added (B); closeout ambiguity protection added (D); Codex 32 KiB README note (C). Net: -4 lines AGENTS.md, §3 moved from line 225 to line 150.

### Attention anchor + §0b position

| Check | Command | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|

## Feature round 12 (2026-04-19): v2.7 — root-fix for SESSION_HANDOFF/SESSION_LOG bloat

Root cause addressed: handoff payload growth and non-executable archive rules caused avoidable startup token overhead and operational drift risk (archive behavior depended on reminders instead of a command gate).

Changes validated:
- `SESSION_HANDOFF` compactness budget rules added and mirrored.
- §4a execution gate enforced via direct trigger evaluation from `SESSION_LOG.md` (no Python requirement in user closeout path).
- Archive logic validation via self-test matrix (line trigger, date trigger, both triggers, retain-two safeguard).
- QA harness includes Category 17 checks (`R27-*`) for trigger-evaluation wording, package-boundary enforcement, checklist row parity, and executable behavior.

### Matrix simulation (token impact, real tokenizer counts)

| Package | Avg save vs baseline (o200k) | Avg save vs baseline (cl100k) | QC pass |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| P0_baseline | 0 | 0 | 6/6 |
| P1_handoff_compact | 377 | 376 | 6/6 |
| P2_auto_archive | 5544 | 5544 | 6/6 |
| **P3_handoff_compact_plus_archive** | **5921** | **5920** | **6/6** |
| P4_aggressive_trim_plus_archive | 6422 | 6415 | 0/6 (rejected: no-loss QC fail) |

### P3 per-scenario savings (o200k)

| Scenario | Save vs baseline | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| S0_current | 377 | PASS |
| S1_plus5_medium | 2268 | PASS |
| S2_plus5_heavy | 4661 | PASS |
| S3_plus12_heavy | 11236 | PASS |
| S4_date_trigger_under400 | 888 | PASS |
| S5_stress_20_mixed | 16096 | PASS |

Decision: adopt `P3_handoff_compact_plus_archive` as the production root-fix package (best valid token reduction under no-loss constraints).

## Feature round 13 (2026-04-20): v2.8 — INIT-only package-boundary hardening

Root cause addressed: user installs rely on `INIT.md` only; references to non-installed internal tooling caused avoidable first-run failures.

Changes validated:
- Removed INIT template block for `FILE 7: docs/qa/session_log_maintenance.py` from user install flow.
- Removed user-facing README references to internal maintenance script/commands.
- Updated checklist row wording from utility-centric to policy-centric to avoid reintroducing non-shipped paths.
- Added hard regression guards:
  - `R27-19`: INIT must not reference `docs/qa/run_checks.sh`
  - `R27-20`: INIT must not reference `docs/qa/session_log_maintenance.py`

Outcome:
- INIT-only installation path is now self-contained.
- README stays user-facing and does not expose internal maintainer tooling.
- Regression baseline increased to 232 checks with package-boundary drift detection built in.

## Manual governance checks (cannot be automated with grep)

These require human or live-session verification:

| Check | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| §10 suppression: if SESSION_HANDOFF contains "PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC suggestion issued: [session ID] [date]", AI must NOT re-suggest in subsequent sessions unless new arch decisions were made | Behavioral | Verify in live session after §10 suggestion is issued |
| §0b step 0: if CODEBASE_CONTEXT does not exist, AI generates it before recording External Services | Behavioral | Verify in first-session scenario with API-calling code |
| §1 generation scan: AI scans README → docs/**/*.md → package manifests → .env.example → yaml configs without modifying source files; consolidates duplicates into one entry | Behavioral | Verify in first-session scenario with multi-source project |
| Cross-tool handoff (A→B): generated Handoff Prompt opens with verbatim Opening line template (AGENTS.md + §1 sequence including PROJECT_MASTER_SPEC); receiving tool reads AGENTS.md first then follows full §1 startup sequence; labeled "Post-startup first action:" appears only after §1 is complete | Behavioral | Verify by pasting handoff prompt into a different AI CLI tool (e.g. Claude Code → Gemini CLI, or Codex → Claude Code); confirm "Post-startup first action:" label is used |
| DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan visible output: at PERSIST phase, response contains "### DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan" block with matched registry rows and Status column; absence of block is immediately flagged | Behavioral | Verify in a live session where CHANGE phase modified files; confirm block appears before PERSIST completes |
| DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST merge on upgrade: re-running INIT.md on project with custom rows in DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md preserves those rows and adds any missing universal rows without overwriting | Behavioral | Verify by running INIT.md on a project that already has DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md with a project-specific row added |
| PERSIST checklist trigger: agent outputs DOC_SYNC Matrix Scan block when CHANGE phase modified files; outputs SKIP notice when no file changes occurred | Behavioral | Verify in two live sessions: one with file changes (block appears), one without (SKIP output or absent) |
| Re-install on existing project: dry-run plan shows merge/skip (not create) for existing files; backup created before first write; SESSION_HANDOFF.md and SESSION_LOG.md left untouched | Behavioral | Verify by running INIT.md on a project that already has governance files |
| A1 — PLAN display: AI states "My understanding:", "Impact scope:", "Assumptions:" at PLAN phase before proceeding to READ; user can see and correct misinterpretation | Behavioral | Verify in a live session with an ambiguous task request |
| A2 — Conflict arbitration: when user instruction conflicts with governance rule, AI states the conflict and risk before complying; override is recorded in SESSION_LOG | Behavioral | Verify by requesting AI to skip a mandatory step (e.g., "don't update session log") |
| A5 — CHANGE deviation stop: when AI discovers mid-CHANGE that assumptions were wrong, it stops and reports instead of self-correcting | Behavioral | Verify by giving a task where the target file has unexpected state |
| B1 — §11 scope: clarifying questions and simple lookups do not include forced "What was done / Why / Verification / Next" output | Behavioral | Verify by asking a simple question (e.g., "what's the build command?") in a governed session |
| QC fail-path: when tests fail during QC phase, AI reports failure summary + diagnosis + proposed fix, does NOT auto-retry or return to CHANGE without user direction | Behavioral | Test prompt: give a task that will produce a test failure (e.g., "add a function that divides by zero, then run tests"). Pass: AI reports what failed, does not silently retry. Fail: AI loops back to CHANGE or retries without asking |
| Deviation resume: after A5 deviation-stop, when user gives new direction, AI explicitly states which phase it's re-entering (PLAN or CHANGE) and why | Behavioral | Test prompt: prepare a file whose state contradicts SESSION_HANDOFF description, then give a task to modify it. After AI stops (A5), say "ok, use approach B instead". Pass: AI says "Re-entering CHANGE because..." or "Restarting from PLAN because scope changed". Fail: AI continues silently without stating phase |
| Closeout false-positive protection: ambiguous end-of-task expressions do NOT trigger full session closeout without confirmation | Behavioral | Test prompt: after completing a task, say "好，這個處理好了，謝謝" or "That's all I needed for this". Pass: AI asks whether to close session. Fail: AI immediately performs full closeout (writes SESSION_HANDOFF, SESSION_LOG, outputs 3-section format) |
