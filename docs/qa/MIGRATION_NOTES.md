# Harness Migration Notes — Legacy Quarantine

## Purpose

`docs/qa/legacy_checks.sh` quarantines 89 historical drift-defense checks (R11/R26/R27 series) that were originally part of `run_checks.sh`. They are not deleted because each one defends against a real regression that occurred during v1.x→v2.6 migrations.

## Why Quarantined

- The main `run_checks.sh` was carrying 224 grep checks, 89 of which were string-matching against historical wording. This made `AGENTS.md` text effectively un-editable: any rephrasing risked breaking grep parity.
- The 89 quarantined checks remain executable but are isolated so the main harness can shrink and `AGENTS.md` can be condensed during v3.0 work without losing historical drift defense.

## Execution Triggers (governance-driven, not memory-driven)

1. **Default auto-chain** — `bash docs/qa/run_checks.sh` automatically chains `legacy_checks.sh`. No flag needed.
2. **Explicit skip** — `LEGACY_SKIP=1 bash docs/qa/run_checks.sh` bypasses the chain. Forbidden by AGENTS.md §3c during Release/Merge verification.
3. **Staleness detection** — Main harness check `H01` fails if `AGENTS.md` mtime exceeds `.legacy_last_run` timestamp by more than 30 days. Forces a re-run before the gap grows.

## Series Inventory

### R11 — Harness Optimization Round 11 (v2.5)

| Check ID | Anchor String | Reason for Defense |
|---|---|---|
| R11-01 / R11-02 | `CORE RULES` | Attention anchor at top of AGENTS / INIT — without this, agents skim past §3 workflow |

| R26-05b / R26-06b | `physically topmost entry wins` | §1 same-date tiebreaker rule |
| R26-07 | `single source of truth for bootstrap root safety` | INIT.md top-block delegates fully to §5a (no parallel rules) |

| R26-36 to R26-39 | `Major separator:` / `Minor separator:` | §4 closeout layout separator rules |

### R27 — P3 Root-Fix (v2.7)

| Check ID | Anchor String | Reason for Defense |
|---|---|---|
| R27-01 / R27-02 | `Session handoff compactness budget` | §4 budget caps existence |
| R27-03 / R27-04 | `evaluate triggers directly from \`dev/SESSION_LOG.md\`` | §4a executable maintenance trigger |

| R27-09 / R27-10 | python self-test + check execution | maintenance script integrity (skipped if Python unavailable) |
| R27-11 to R27-18 | `session_log_maintenance.py` / `python docs/qa/session_log_maintenance.py` (negative) | All 4 README variants must hide internal maintenance script |
| R27-19 / R27-20 | `docs/qa/run_checks.sh` / `docs/qa/session_log_maintenance.py` (negative) in INIT | INIT.md package self-containment |

## Self-Deprecation Path

A check may be retired from `legacy_checks.sh` when **all** the following are true:
1. The original drift situation has been replaced by an equivalent or stronger check in the main harness (e.g. behavior marker, structural anchor)
2. The check has passed continuously for ≥3 releases without any related drift incident
3. Removing the check is recorded in this file with a "retired" note and the replacement check ID

Retired checks are deleted from `legacy_checks.sh` (not commented out) and noted here for audit history.

## Adding to Legacy

If a future release patches a regression that depended on specific wording:
1. Add a check to `legacy_checks.sh` (do not add to main `run_checks.sh`)
2. Append a row to the appropriate series table in this file with the anchor string and defense reason
3. The check participates in auto-chain from day one
